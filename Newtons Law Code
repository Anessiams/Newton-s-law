//Newton’s law states that the force, F, between two bodies of masses M1 and M2 is given by:
//F=k(M1M2/d^2)
//in which k is the gravitational constant and d is the distance between the bodies. The value of k is approximately 6.67 X 10-8 dyn. cm²/g² .
//Instructions
//Write a program that prompts the user to input:
//1. The masses of the bodies
//2. The distance between the bodies.
//The program then outputs:
//1. The force between the bodies.
